    <h2 class="first">About the Partnership</h2>
    <p>I had first heard about WRSPC when my web design professor connected my fellow students and I to their program coordinator. We were tasked with creating blogs posts which WRSPC would then post onto their website blog. 
        Near the end of this course, I contacted the program coordinator to inquire if I could volunteer in order to gain more experience in the field of design. She agreed and we began working together on graphics and other website content I could create.
        During this time, my university informed students that there was a funding opportunity for students who are volunteering for a non-profit organization. I inquired and was accepted. My position switched from student volunteer to placement student at WRSPC, and my UX journey began here! 
    </p>
<br>
    <h2 class="first">Goal</h2>
    <p>The program coordinator of WRSPC and I worked side-by-side to discover what exactly our goal was:<br>
    <b>To re-design the WRSPC website so that it is more user-friendly. Primarily focusing on the navigation and secondarily focusing on the aesthetics.</b><br><br>
    The <b>navigation</b> needed to be user-friendly because website visitors were proven to be individuals under severe stress who are looking for quick and easily accessibly information. Therefore, primary and urgent information needed to be easy to spot, while secondary and other information did not need to be of primary focus.<br><br>
    <b>Aesthetics</b> were also important because the website needed to look appealing in order to not only attract visitors, but keep them exploring the website and finding important information about suicide.

    <h2 class="second">Initial Research</h2>
    <p>Initial research was done before user testing to get a look at where the problems within the website were. This allowed us to obtain knowledge and get a more focused direction of what topics to shape user interviews and surveys around.<br><br>
    I conducted a Heuristic Evaluation of the <a href="https://wrspc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">WRPSC website</a>, which you can view <a href="img/Heuristic Evaluation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">here</a>.<br><br>
    I visited the website's Google Analytics to view user demographics. Based off of some of this data, I created <a href="img/Personas.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">two personas</a> to get a better understanding of the kind of users that visit the website.
    I also created an <a href="img/Empathy Map.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">empathy map</a> and a <a href="img/Journey Map.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">journey map</a>.
    </p>
    <br>

<h2 class="second">User Testing</h2>
    <p>We created an in-depth <a href="img/User Research Plan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="SDPstyle">user research plan</a> which outlined our user research methods and our timeline.</p><br>
    We agreed to proceed with Unmoderated Remote Usability Testing (aka. URUT) and Contextual Inquiry, and only use Card Sorting if needed, such as if we did not obtain enough data from the first two methodologies.

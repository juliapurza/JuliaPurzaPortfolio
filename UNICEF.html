    <br><br>
        <p style="font-size:23px">The <b>UNICEF Wellbeing Survey</b> is a mobile application which gives Canadian children and youth a voice about issues in their homes and communities. This mobile application engages children and youth through the use of games while asking them to answer certain questions. UNICEF and municipalities to which this survey is distributed will be able to collect important data on the state of wellbeing of children and youth in their communities.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="first">Goal</h2>
    <p>My design team for this project consisted of five other students from our design thinking course. We were partnered with <i>Overlap Associates</i>, a design agency based in Kitchener, ON, who tasked us with creating a wellbeing survey targeted to children and youth. 
        This survey would be used by UNICEF in order to compile information on the wellbeing of children and youth in Canada. My team's main goal was to design the survey content and interface so that it is highly engaging for young individuals between the ages of 6 and 15. 
        While we were partned with <i>Overlap Associates</i>, we frequently communicated with our course professor who was a guide and lead designer for us, providing us with help and advice along our seven-week design process.

    </p><br>

    <h2 class="second">My Responsibility</h2>
    <p>After a group discussion on project roles, I was tasked with:<br>
        <li style="list-style-type: numbered;">&nbsp;Conducting secondary research</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: numbered;">&nbsp;User testing</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: numbered;">&nbsp;Working on the hi-fi prototype in Adobe XD
        <li style="list-style-type: numbered;">&nbsp;Being one of three final presenters to Overlap Associates</li>
    </p><br>

    <h2 class="second">Research</h2>
        <h3>User Needs</h3>
        <p><b>UNICEF and municipalities</b> need an easy and effective way to acquire data from children and youth</p>
        <p><b>Children and youth</b> need to feel heard and be able to express their feelings; to feel engaged</p>
        <h3>Primary Research</h3>
            <p>Due to ethical reasons, my team was not permitted to have direct contact with children and youth under the age of 18, so we interviewed parents instead. The purpose of these interviews were to gain a deeper understanding about child and youth electronic habits.
                We created a set of questions which each team member used to interview parents they knew outside of their immediate family through platforms like ZOOM, over the phone, or in person.<br>
                <li>What age should children be to have access to a phone?</li>
                <li>On average, how many hours of screen time does your child have each week?</li>
                <li>Who are you comfortable with having access to your child's data from surveys?</li>
                <li>Would you be comfortable with your child filling out a survey about their wellbeing?</li>
                <li>Would you be comfortable if municipalities used that information to help them and others out?</li><br>
                We obtained eight survey results. From these, we were able to learn that:<br>
                ❶ &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost all children had access to a mobile phone<br>
                ❷ &nbsp;&nbsp;Most parents are comfortable with their children filling out a wellbeing survey, as long as it is <b>anonymous</b><br>
                ❸ &nbsp;&nbsp;Most parents were comfortable with municipalities collecting data on their child's wellbeing in order to help others<br>
                <br>
                My team and I also spoke to a <b>grade one teacher</b> who informed us that younger children have a short attention span and youth get easily bored, therefore the survey needs to be simplified but also fun and engaging so that the completion rate is high and UNICEF obtains the data they need.
            </p><br>

        <h3>Secondary Research</h3>
            <p>Because we did not have direct access to children and youth, we felt we needed to do a more research. Secondary research conducted consisted of looking at existing children and youth surveys and researching which platform would be best to create this survey on.<br><br>
                Some other things we discovered while looking at online resources and peer reviewed journals are: 
                <li>To keep questions shorts</li>
                <li>Gamification is highly effective within surveys</li>
                <li>Include incentives</li>
                <li>Have a template for the survey so that different municipalities can change it as needed</li>
                <li>Have the ability to skip questions if they feel intrusive</li><br>
            <b>Gamification</b> was a major part of our research as we realized we wanted to go in this direction. We decided that children and youth would be more inclined to particiate and complete the survey if it was in the form of a simple game. Here are some facts about gamification: 
                <li>Gamified surveys lead to a higher response and completion rate</li>
                <li>Gamified surveys lead to a higher self-resported satisfaction rate</li>
                <li>Subsequent responses are likely, meaning that participants are more likely to paricipate in future surveys and activities</li>
                <li>Humans are naturally competitive, having a desire to play games and feel engaged</li>
            </p>
        <br>

    <h2 class="second">Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>We used an <b>affinity map</b> to help categorize all of our collective ideas. While doing this, we were on a live Discord chat discussing our ideas. <br><br><img src="img/UNICEFaffinitymap.png" height="75%" width="75%" class="brainstormingpics"><br><br><br>
        Next, we completed a <b>value proposition canvas</b> to help us see how our concept of a gamified survey would be beneficial for both our client and the user. This also helped us to better see any possible pain points and solutions for them.<br><br>

<p class="description"><b class="aboutme">Hey, I'm Julia Purza</b><br><br>
    I am a second year student at <span class="hoverp">Wilfrid</span><span class="hovery">&nbsp;Laurier</span><span class="hoverr">&nbsp;University</span> in Brantford, Ontario where I am majoring in User Experience Design (a.k.a. UX Design).<br><br>
    It took me some time to discover a field I am so passionate about. I attended a program at Conestoga College in Kitchener, ON called Design Foundations to obtain a deeper understanding of the field of design. After this, I was accepted to Ryerson University for the Bachelor of Fashion Design program in Toronto, ON. However, I realized this program was not for me.
    Although dropping the fashion program and applying for Wilfrid Laurier's User Experience Design program seemed drastic at the time, I am extremely glad this journey brought me here.<br><br>
    I have extensive knowledge of Adobe programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and XD. Laurier has taken me on experiences of working with real clients, further strengthening my communication and collaboration skills. Currently, I am working on several group projects as well as on a professional website which I am coding from scratch using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript languages.

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal of this group project was to create a speculative design that engages multiple somatic experiences (visual, auditory, haptic and kinaesthetic) that human beings encounter through the sense of sight, hearing, touch, and motion.
        <br><br>We were also required to align with the Brantford BIA (Downtown Brantford Business Association) Strategic Plan, a plan that aims to revitalize and maintain a dynamic local community and promote the area of downtown Brantford as a business and shopping destination. With these boundaries in mind, we worked to design a speculative haptic tool.

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>Tinkercad.
    <br>Adobe Illustrator.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Brantford has little traffic coming into their local businesses.<br>
        Businesses have difficulty connecting with the local community.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Users</h2>
    <p>Brantford citizens: <i>How can I find the right business for my needs?</i><br>
    Brantford businesses: <i>How can we reach the community more effectively?</i>
<br><br>The Question: <b>How might we utilize accessible and multisensorial technology to engage the Brantford community with local businesses?</b>
</p> 
<br><br>

    <h2>Final Prototypes</h2>
    <p>Our group worked to create accurate visuals of our vision for this project.<br><br>
    <p><b>Below</b></p>

    <p><b>Below</b></p>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Digital.png" width="800" height="450">
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>Below</b> are sample coupons which will be subtly placed around downtown Brantford for local citizens to discover. This adds some fun and mystery into the idea of QR codes. When the user scans the code, they will be provided with a coupon pop-up which they can decide to save or not.
        <br><br>For example, if the user scans a retail coupon, they will be directed to a specific retail store coupon within the city of Brantford which is assigned to that QR code, and same goes for food businesses.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>HOW is our design a haptic tool?</h3><br>
    <p><b>Sight</b> is engaged through the contrast of the QR code against the background, through the colored indicators corresponding to the type of business, and through the light at nighttime.<br><br>
     <b>Hearing</b> is engaged through the *ding* sound after a successful scan.<br><br>
     <b>Touch</b> is engaged by the 3D box, the 3D bubble sticker, and the vibration from the phone after a successful scan.<br><br>
     <b>Motion</b> is engaged when the user brings up their phone to scan the QR code.

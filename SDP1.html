    <h1 class="map">Speculative Design Project ONE</h1>
    <h2 class="first">Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal of this group project was to create a speculative design that engages the somatic experiences (visual, auditory, haptic and kinaesthetic) that humans encounter through sight, hearing, touch, and motion.
        <br><br>Our group was also required to align with the Brantford BIA (Downtown Brantford Business Association) Strategic Plan, a plan that aims to revitalize and maintain a dynamic local community, and promote the area of downtown Brantford as a business and shopping destination.
        <br><br>With these boundaries in mind, we worked to design a 3D speculative haptic tool.

<h2 class="second">Problem and Users</h2>
    <p>Businesses are having difficulty connecting with the local community within downtown Brantford.<br><br>
        Brantford citizens: <i>How can I find the right business for my needs?</i><br>
        Brantford businesses: <i>How can we reach the community more effectively?</i>
        <br><br><b>How might we utilize accessible and multisensorial technology to engage the Brantford community with local businesses?</b>
</p><br>

<h2 class="second">Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Each downtown Brantford business would have a 3D QR code mounted to their wall (outside, inside or both). When scanned, it would lead the user to the businesses' website or whatever platform the business chooses to send the user.<br><br>
    The QR code is 3D as our group was to adhere to the assignment requirement of creating a 3D haptic design. Over the course of our design process, we realized a 3D QR code is more effective because it really grabs the eyes of customers / passerbys.
    <br><br>In addition, there will be QR code stickers hidden around downtown Brantford to be found by citizens and redeemed at local businesses. They are color-coded with icons indicating the type of business, such as food or retail.
</p><br>

    <h2 class="second">Hi-Fi Prototypes</h2>
    <p>Our group worked together over the course of one month to create accurate visuals of our vision for this project.<br><br>
    <p><b>Below</b> you can see how the 3D QR code that is to be mounted to business walls looks like. The light is meant to turn on when the surrounding area darkens so that it can be easily seen by customers or passerbys. The contrast of the QR code against its background allows it to be easily scanned.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>Below</b> are examples of possible destination pages subsequent to the user scanning the QR code of a business. The example here is Shawarmania in downtown Brantford. If the user wants to see or save the location, they click on "Location."<br><br>
        To the right is an example of a pop-up subsequent to the user scanning a hidden coupon QR code.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>Below</b> are examples of coupon QR codes which will be subtly placed around downtown Brantford for local citizens to discover. This incorporates some fun and mystery into our idea of innovative QR codes. Subsequent to the user scanning the code, they will be provided with a coupon pop-up which they can choose to save or not.
        <br><br>For example, if the user scans the retail coupon to the left, they will be directed to a specific retail store coupon within the city of Brantford which is assigned to that QR code. We theorized this will bring more traffic to local businesses as well.</p>

    <h2 class="second">HOW</h2>
    <h3>HOW is our design a haptic tool?</h3>
    <p>‚úîÔ∏è <b>Sight</b> is engaged through the contrast of the QR code against the background, through the colored indicators corresponding to the type of business, and through the light at nighttime<br>
        ‚úîÔ∏è <b>Hearing</b> is engaged through the *ding* sound after a successful scan<br>
        ‚úîÔ∏è <b>Touch</b> is engaged by the 3D box, the 3D bubble sticker, and the vibration from the phone after a successful scan<br>
        ‚úîÔ∏è <b>Motion</b> is engaged when the user brings up their phone to scan the QR code

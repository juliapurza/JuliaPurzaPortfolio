    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal of this group project was to create a speculative design that engages multiple somatic experiences (visual, auditory, haptic and kinaesthetic) that human beings encounter through the sense of sight, hearing, touch, and motion.
        <br><br>We were also required to align with the Brantford BIA (Downtown Brantford Business Association) Strategic Plan, a plan that aims to revitalize and maintain a dynamic local community and promote the area of downtown Brantford as a business and shopping destination. With these boundaries in mind, we worked to design a speculative haptic tool.

    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>Tinkercad.
    <br>Adobe Illustrator.
</p>
<br>

<h2>User Problems</h2>
    <p>Businesses are have difficulty connecting with the local communit of downtown Brantford.<br><br>
        Brantford citizens: <i>How can I find the right business for my needs?</i><br>
        Brantford businesses: <i>How can we reach the community more effectively?</i>
        <br><br>Our Question:<br><b>How might we utilize accessible and multisensorial technology to engage the Brantford community with local businesses?</b>
</p>
<br>

<h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
<p>Each downtown Brantford business would have a 3D QR code mounted to their business wall (outside, inside or both).<br>
    When scanned, this QR code would lead the user to the businesses' website<br><br>
    In addition, there will be QR code stickers hidden around downtown Brantford to be found by citizens and redeemed at local businesses. They are color-coded with icons indicating the type of business (food, retail).
</p>
<br>

    <h2>Final Prototypes</h2>
    <p>Our group worked to create accurate visuals of our vision for this project.<br><br>
    <p><b>Below</b> you can see how the 3D QR code that is to be mounted to business walls looks like. The light is meant to turn on when the surrounding area darkens so that it can be easily seen by customers or passerby's. The contrast of the QR code against its background allows it to be easily scanned by the user.</p>

        <img src="img/3D.png" width="800" height="450">
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>Below</b> you can see an example of how the user's phone would look like after scanning the QR code of a certain business. The business is our example of Shawarmania in Brantford. If the user wants to see or save the location, they click on "Location" and are lead to Google Maps. <br><br>On the right is an example of where a coupon QR code hidden around the city would bring the user after scanning.</p>

    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><b>Below</b> are sample coupons which will be subtly placed around downtown Brantford for local citizens to discover. This adds some fun and mystery into the idea of QR codes. When the user scans the code, they will be provided with a coupon pop-up which they can decide to save or not.
        <br><br>For example, if the user scans a retail coupon, they will be directed to a specific retail store coupon within the city of Brantford which is assigned to that QR code, and same goes for food businesses.</p>

    <h3>HOW is our design a haptic tool?</h3><br>
    <p><b>Sight</b> is engaged through the contrast of the QR code against the background, through the colored indicators corresponding to the type of business, and through the light at nighttime.<br>
     <b>Hearing</b> is engaged through the *ding* sound after a successful scan.<br>
     <b>Touch</b> is engaged by the 3D box, the 3D bubble sticker, and the vibration from the phone after a successful scan.<br>
     <b>Motion</b> is engaged when the user brings up their phone to scan the QR code.
 </p><br><br>

 <h3>Summary</h3>
 <p>Our design will bring more people to local businesses and creates a memorable experience for the community</p>

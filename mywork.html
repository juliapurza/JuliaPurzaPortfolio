<h1 class="enjoy">MY WORK</h2><br>
<h2 class="h3work1">UX201: Maker Lab l</h2>
<p class="pwork">This is a course that focuses on making and the "tinkering" mindset. I had the opportunity to design and create several protoypes, both digital and physical. One of these is the paper airplane manual you see below. The idea was to portray a clear manual that the user can make use of to build their own paper airplane without any confusion.</p>
    <h3 class="myangle1">My Angle</h3>
        <p class="myangle">UX Design requires many skills, but one of the most important is writing. The ability to properly communicate ideas through writing is important when working in a professional environment, such as with clients. Practicing writing as a design student, or any student, is ideal. Assignments and essays completed in education are important in developing this skill and will most certainly pay off in the future.<br><br>
    The assignment below is an example of my writing and communication skills. It is a paper airplane making manual which describes, both through writing and visually, how to create a paper airplane step by step. The purpose was to be as clear as possible, using as little words as possible, to communicate clearly to the reader.</p><br>

<h2 class="h3work">UX230: Interaction Design</h2>
<p class="pwork">This course focuses on the development of high quality user interaction designs for different user experiences. Concepts from several disciplines are used to introduce to us the cognitive, perceptual, physiological, and social aspects of interactivity. Below is a group assignment I participated in. It is focused on improving PhotoShop and its accessibility features.</p>
    <h3 class="myangle2">My Angle</h3>
        <p class="myangle">Accessibility is the practice of making something usable by as many people as possible. This is something that is often overlooked in everyday life. Usability is so important, and within it, feedback. Feedback communicates the results of an interaction to the user, letting them know if something has been completed and whether it is right or wrong. Below, my group and I wanted to focus on this aspect as PhotoShop is notorious for the lack of feedback in their menu.</p>

<h2 class="h3work">Conestoga College Graphics</h2>
<p class="pwork">This was a project and competition given to all students in the program. Our objective was to create designs for a poster, brochure, and ticket for the year-end art show. There were 120 students in the program and this design came in the top 20.</p>
    <h3 class="myangle3">My Angle</h3>
        <p class="myangle">Graphic design is a field that is often overlooked, but it allows for the visual communication of important messages. These messages can be for the purpose of entertainment, politics, medicine, and so much more. Graphic design can take important messages and portray them in a visually interesting way that allows for more effective distribution of information. At Conestoga College, we focused heavily on graphic design and its influences.<br><br>
            Below I took my previous fine arts abstract piece and recreated it using Illustrator. It is mainly meant to represent the connection between the students, the professors and all the work we have done together. This visual allows for the viewer to really think about what they’re looking at.</p>
